# Write code for the generator function primes. This function takes one input n, which is the value from which you want
# to start the prime sequence. It returns the prime numbers, no less than the value of n and no greater than 100.
# Please note that you are required to write the function as a generator function.
# When you execute the above code, the output is 2, 3, 5. You are required to use the isPrime function that is provided
# to you above, to check if the current value of n is a prime number.
